An old e-mail about receiving peer reviews
------------------------------------------

"...it is possible we get our referee reports back ...

Even when the reviews are good, they are often worded in a way that sounds harsh. It is difficult to tell whether we should resubmit and rebut, or move to another journal, without careful thinking.

My rule is that, when I get review reports, I read them fully, then I set them aside for 24 hours for my emotions to cool before I think about next steps.

`The history of scientific progress <https://www.sciencealert.com/these-8-papers-were-rejected-before-going-on-to-win-the-nobel-prize>`_ is contained in all the papers that were, at first, rejected. The following advice I was given by my friends in high school: If you are not getting rejected some of the time, you are not aiming high enough!"



An old e-mail about accepting a conference invitation
-----------------------------------------------------

"Many times, I've made decisions to spend time with family and friends rather than scientific opportunities, and I have never ever regretted it. A few times, I've tried to juggle too many things simultaneously, and then I've sometimes regretted it -- feeling like I gave both family & science my "leftovers". I have also had events where the most valuable thing was simply showing up, to show support for family or friends, e.g., to give one specific hug, and it didn't matter whether it lasted 1 minute or 3 days. If it were me making this decision, I would think of it as speaking at the conference and giving my family my leftovers (which might be enough) versus going to the family event, and giving the conference my leftovers (in which case we can't commit to speaking)."
