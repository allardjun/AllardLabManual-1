"A user guide to Jun"
---------------------

1. How long should you stay stuck on something, trying to figure it out for yourself, before coming for help? About one week.

2. The best way to reach me is e-mail.

3. Under normal operations, the turnaround time for e-mails is within 48hrs of "business time" (e.g. weekdays). Sometimes it is crunch time or something logistical (we're at a conference, we're hosting a visitor), and turnaround needs to be faster. Sometimes it gets slower, e.g., when you're on vacation, or weekends or planned time-off.

4. **It is more important for me to know when you're on reduced effort than that your effort be maximal.**

5. I take working with collaborators seriously.  By far the most impactful stuff we do is collaborative, but collaboration means it's not just about you. I take my role here seriously and expect you to as well.

6. I take student privacy seriously, and I take openness with students seriously.

7. Time is the single most important resource, both materially and symbolically. Not wasting other people's time means showing up on-time to meetings and not going over in a formal time allotment.


..
   1. My most foundational belief is this: Different people have different goals. We should celebrate and exploit this heterogeneity. We should try to maximize everyone's happiness in their own definition. Almost always, this means the following: if something is win-win, win-neutral, or neutral-win, we do it, and if it is anything else (win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, lose-neutral,...) we should not. In my culture this is called "pareto". The world would be worse if we all had the same goals.  


Jun's notes on finding productivity
-----------------------------------

- I came up Jun's 3 rules for productivity way way back when I was an undergrad at Queen's. They are not universal. But even after all this time, they still ring true.
  
    1. Break before you're forced to. Break often and break well.
    2. As a corollary to the first, Push when you don't have to. Find projects that you *want* to push when you don't have to.
    3. And finally, Act as if nothing more is going to get done next week, next quarter, next year (what I now call "the Fallacy of Next Quarter").

- If you look at your agenda and you feel overwhelmed, subdivide your tasks into subtasks. If you're still overwhelmed, cut them up again. Repeat, until each task fits in half-hour chunk. Then start doing. When rock climbing, sometimes you look up from your current position, you see no holds, no path up. It is amazing how different the wall looks when you pull yourself up even by a few inches -- new holds and pathways are revealed.

- How much time should you spend making yourself faster, eg by automation? See `XKCD Productivity tip <https://xkcd.com/1205/>`_
