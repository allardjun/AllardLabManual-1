Being an effective scientific communicator
------------------------------------------

We spend a lot of time on communication, optimizing presentations, poster, paper figures. This is for a few reasons.

1. Clear thinking means clear communicating, and clear communicating is clear thinking. There is almost never a distinction in effort.

2. Science gains from network effects, but only if each lab/scientist devotes effort to communicating and coordinating. Like a high-performance computer devoting some of its cpu time to parallelization.


The elements  
------------

There is a standard layout -- the time-tested most powerful layout -- for a  scientific contribution that works particularly well. 

- Big question/background
- Specific question/hypothesis -- what you will deliver in this work
- "Here we"
- Method
- Results
- Impact

Here are some examples of paper abstracts and layouts:

Approach and gap are of equal importance
----------------------------------------

"When I sit down with colleagues over a beer at a meeting, we don't go over the facts, we don't talk about what's known; we talk about what we'd like to figure out, about what needs to be done... This crucial element in science was being left out for the students." - Stuart Firestein (Columbia Neuroscience)

Doing science involves two activities of equal importance:

(1) Identifying the gap in current knowledge/needs

(2) Modeling/experiment approach and carrying out that approach

An analogy is “product-market fit”.

It's ok to have one before you have the other (exploratory projects, "approach first" projects, "question first" projects,...) and it almost always happens that the approach and gap change throughout a project.

The importance rigor resources trade-off
--------------------------------------------------

A useful coordinate system to "project" (verb) success as a project progresses:

(1) Importance/impact of the result: This importance criteria is often the easiest to retreat on, because there is an attitude in the scientific community that scientists are bad at predicting future importance anyway.

(2) Rigor/completeness. How much did we explore all the "nooks and crannies", eg parameter sweeps? How much did we reject alternative possibilities? How much did we test the tools?

(3) Efficiency/use of resources/speed: Are we going to get this paper done in time, so people can move on to even bigger and brighter things!

There is a fuzzy, probabilistic minimal threshold for each of these.

Above the threshold, there is a trade-off between them. Teams benefit from discussing this trade-off.

Don't underestimate the value of speed. There are many exciting things you can get on board, but for which "The bus leaves at 9:00", meaning there is a specific point in time you need to hit a milestone. Don't fear these things. How do you meet deadlines in such a fuzzy, probabilistic endeavor? :ref:`DevOps <DevOps>`.  

Figures!
--------

* What makes a great figure? :download:`Slides about figures </Content/manual_Figures.key>`.

Upshot: You need the ability to make a figure that is publication grade, informative, and digestible. *Not a pixel out of place.*

The "Masterful Inaction" principle: it's ok to make a quick figure, as long as you're doing it because you have the ability to make a publication-quality figure and have deliberately made the decision not to.

The under-rated power of writing
--------------------------------

The paper - meaning a 4-10 page document, written in full sentences, describing a gap in knowledge, a method, a result, and its impact - is a highly-rated and yet still under-rated mode of communication. Nothing compares.

* Start the latex doc early! Prototype latex doc that Jun uses personally in `this git repo <https://github.com/allardjun/JunsLatexRepository>`_. (This is good for Project Seeds, and papers. Probably not good for thesis.)

* A lot of writing will get thrown away as the project evolves. **Writing is never wasted.** 

* "When people present an idea in slides, everyone says 'yaaa that's greaaaat'. But when you make them write it down in a 1-page proposal, suddenly the problems become clear, and the needed improvement becomes clear." - Qing Nie, paraphrased by Jun.  In many cases in our projects, we have a fantastic presentation (poster or slide deck) about a year before we have a great paper.

* "The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than 'writing' a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how things are related."" Jeff Bezos, quoted in `"Write documentation first, then build" <https://reproof.app/blog/document-first-then-build>`_. Similar point made by economist and philanthropist Tyler Cowan in "`Against slide decks <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/08/against-slide-decks.html>`_" (I'm not against slide decks though.)


The :ref:`paper writing process <PaperWritingTips>`

Getting to scientific quality / rigor
-------------------------------------

Note many steps involve feedback to previous steps (e.g., in oral part you often realize you need a figure modification). 
So, in true :ref:`DevOps <DevOps>` philosophy, plan to revisit every step. 

- 11: Wishlist of figure and key sentences. Statement of gap that is being filled; wishlist of figures etc that address it.
- 10: Draft figures with preliminary computation/data 
- 9: Draft figures with publication-grade computation/data
- 8: Abstract draft. Decision about whether to submit to the conference. 
- 7: Presentation-grade figures
- 6: Poster first draft. (Jun requests that paragraphs copied in a separate document e.g., Google doc, for easier editing.)

  * 5: poster draft 2nd round
  * 4: poster draft 3rd round sometimes 

- 3: Oral part practice, 1-on-1. Not a time trial yet, mostly about content.
- 2: Oral practice, with audience e.g. Allard Lab. Time trial. 
- 1: For posters, final version to printer. For talks, final time-trial practice 1-on-1. 

It's a slog. Cycling through these steps get faster, and more independent. But the steps never go away. 
Scientists venturing into their first forays into research take about 1 week per step. 
A question for you: How do you get faster and more independent, as you mature scientifically?
