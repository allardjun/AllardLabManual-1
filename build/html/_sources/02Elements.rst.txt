Being an effective scientific communicator
------------------------------------------

We spend a lot of time on communication, optimizing presentations, poster, paper figures. This is for a few reasons.

1. Clear thinking means clear communicating, and clear communicating is clear thinking. There is almost never a distinction in effort.

2. Science gains from network effects, but only if each lab/scientist devotes effort to communicating and coordinating. Like a high-performance computer devoting some of its cpu time to parallelization.


The elements  
------------

There is a standard layout -- the time-tested most powerful layout -- for a  scientific contribution that works particularly well. 

- Big question/background
- Specific question/hypothesis -- what you will deliver in this work
- "Here we"
- Method
- Results
- Impact

Here are some examples of paper abstracts and layouts:

Approach and gap are of equal importance
----------------------------------------

"When I sit down with colleagues over a beer at a meeting, we don't go over the facts, we don't talk about what's known; we talk about what we'd like to figure out, about what needs to be done... This crucial element in science was being left out for the students." - Stuart Firestein (Columbia Neuroscience)

Doing science involves two activities of equal importance:

(1) Identifying the gap in current knowledge/needs

(2) Modeling/experiment approach and carrying out that approach

An analogy is “product-market fit”.

It's ok to have one before you have the other (exploratory projects, "approach first" projects, "question first" projects,...) and it almost always happens that the approach and gap change throughout a project.

The importance rigor resources trade-off
--------------------------------------------------

A useful coordinate system to "project" (verb) success as a project progresses:

   :width: 400px

(1) Importance/impact of the result: This importance criteria is often the easiest to retreat on, because there is an attitude in the scientific community that scientists are bad at predicting future importance anyway.

(2) Rigor/completeness/quality. How much did we explore all the "nooks and crannies", eg parameter sweeps? How much did we reject alternative possibilities? How much did we test the tools? Also in this category is the quality of presentation. How clear do the figures, text, code repositories, tables, communicate the result?

(3) Efficiency/use of resources/speed: Are we going to get this paper done in time, so people can move on to even bigger and brighter things!

There is a fuzzy, probabilistic minimal threshold for each of these.

Above the threshold, there is a trade-off between them. Teams benefit from discussing this trade-off.

Don't underestimate the value of speed. There are many exciting things you can get on board, but for which "The bus leaves at 9:00", meaning there is a specific point in time you need to hit a milestone. Don't fear these things. How do you meet deadlines in such a fuzzy, probabilistic endeavor? :ref:`DevOps <DevOps>`.  

Figures!
--------

* What makes a great figure? :download:`Slides about figures </Content/manual_Figures.key>`.

Upshot: You need the ability to make a figure that is publication grade, informative, and digestible. *Not a pixel out of place.*

The "Masterful Inaction" principle: it's ok to make a quick figure, as long as you're doing it because you have the ability to make a publication-quality figure and have deliberately made the decision not to.

The under-rated power of writing
--------------------------------

The paper - meaning a 4-10 page document, written in full sentences, describing a gap in knowledge, a method, a result, and its impact - is a highly-rated and yet still under-rated mode of communication. Nothing compares.

* Start the latex doc early! Prototype latex doc that Jun uses personally in `this git repo <https://github.com/allardjun/JunsLatexRepository>`_. (This is good for Project Seeds, and papers. Probably not good for thesis.)

* A lot of writing will get thrown away as the project evolves. **Writing is never wasted.** 

* "When people present an idea in slides, everyone says 'yaaa that's greaaaat'. But when you make them write it down in a 1-page proposal, suddenly the problems become clear, and the needed improvement becomes clear." - Qing Nie, paraphrased by Jun.  In many cases in our projects, we have a fantastic presentation (poster or slide deck) about a year before we have a great paper.

* "The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than 'writing' a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how things are related."" Jeff Bezos, quoted in `"Write documentation first, then build" <https://reproof.app/blog/document-first-then-build>`_. Similar point made by economist and philanthropist Tyler Cowan in "`Against slide decks <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/08/against-slide-decks.html>`_" (I'm not against slide decks though.)


The :ref:`paper writing process <PaperWritingTips>`

Getting to scientific quality / rigor
-------------------------------------

The process of getting something to scientific standard quality involves many steps. 
Note many steps involve feedback to previous steps (e.g., in oral part you often realize you need a figure modification). 
So, in true :ref:`DevOps <DevOps>` philosophy, you should plan to revisit every step. 
We have a rigorous imposed timeline when getting ready to present a result to the outside world. 
The time it takes for each step get shorter with experience and trust with the collaborators and with me. 
In general during a science project, I try to serve as an advisor rather than a gatekeeper, but in terms of communicating and exposing it to the world, here I invoke my prerogative to be more controlling, at least at first. 

- 9: Outline of **narrative**, i.e., "key sentences" "headlines"; Wishlist of figure and key sentences. Statement of gap that is being filled; wishlist of figures etc that address it. 
- 8: Draft figures with preliminary computation/data and key sentences. This is the **proof-of-concept** point. 
- 7: Draft figures with publication-grade computation/data and key sentences. Figures are understandable, rigorous. **This is the **result-production cutoff** date. 
- 6: Abstract draft. Decision about whether to submit to the conference. Jun approves draft. Ok to make commitments, e.g., submit an abstract to BPS/ASCB/SIAM, to begin convening Committee for Advancement, ...
- 5: **Presentation-grade figures**
- 3&4: Complete (begin to end) **slide/poster first draft**. Draft of intro, background, lit review. (For posters, Jun requests that paragraphs copied in a separate document e.g., Google doc, for easier editing.) Plan for around 1x-2x rounds of back-and-forth with Jun, from the time of this first complete draft. 
- 3&4: Presentation **run-through with Jun**. No time-trial. See if everything hangs together. For talks: what slides are needed, how should they be designed? For posters: What's the layout?
- 2: **Oral practice with audience** e.g. Allard Lab. Time trial. 
- 1: Final time-trial practice 1-on-1.  For posters, final version to printer. Focus on oral (spoken words); when you're done the slides, you're half done, because the spoken words are half the experience. 

It's a slog. Cycling through these steps get faster, and more independent. But the steps never go away. 
People embarking on their first forays into research take about 1 week per step. ("Are you kidding me, 9 weeks to make a damned poster/talk?!")
A question for you to be always asking yourself: How do you get faster and more independent, as you mature scientifically?
When going through this for the first time, I insist on a number of weeks for each step. 
As you become more experience and I get over my trust issues, the steps accelerate --in some cases a lot! (this acceleration is an honor for me to watch, and one of the single biggest joys in my professional life) -- but they sorta never go away.
